# About

This is the repository of a small application I made to teach with simple
interactive demonstration.

The objective are

- Simple API.

- Automatic creation of control.

- No specific knowledge to create new demonstration except python itself.

- Authors is fully in charge of the demonstration.

- Presentation in classroom.

Looks the =demos= directory.

# Installation

The software is in unstable state and in development. At this time, I made it
for *my* needs only.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
3. In the root directory run `poetry install` to install dependencies.

After that you just have to launch it with `poetry run python3 teachapp.py`
